*   Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.
*   Make sure it properly covers your nose, mouth and chin. 
*   When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric mask, or dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.
*   Don’t use masks with valves.
